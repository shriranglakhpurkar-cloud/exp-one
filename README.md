THEORY:-Mathematical Operations in Python

Python provides built-in operators to perform basic mathematical calculations easily.

Addition (Sum)

The + operator is used to add two or more numbers in Python.


Subtraction

The - operator is used to subtract one number from another.


Multiplication

The * operator is used to multiply numbers.


Division

The / operator performs division and always returns a float value.


Floor Division

The // operator returns the quotient without the decimal part.


Modulus Operation

The % operator returns the remainder of a division.


Power Operation

The ** operator is used to raise a number to a power.


Area of a Circle (Basic Formula)

The area of a circle is calculated using the formula π × r × r, where r is the radius.


Calculating Area of a Circle in Python

Python can calculate the area of a circle by using a fixed value of π (3.14).


Math Library in Python

Python provides a built-in math module for advanced mathematical operations.


Area of a Circle Using Math Library

The value of π can be accessed using math.pi for more accurate results.


Logarithmic Operations

Logarithmic functions are used to calculate logarithms of numbers.


Natural Logarithm

The math.log() function calculates the natural logarithm (base e).


Logarithm with Base 10

The math.log10() function is used to calculate logarithms with base 10

.

ALGORITHM:-Algorithm to Perform Sum Operation

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare two variables a and b

Step 3: Read the values of a and b

Step 4: Calculate sum = a + b

Step 5: Display the value of sum

Step 6: Stop

2. Algorithm to Calculate Area of a Circle (Without Math Library)

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare variable r for radius

Step 3: Read the value of r

Step 4: Assign value π = 3.14

Step 5: Calculate area using formula

   area = π × r × r
   
Step 6: Display the area of the circle

Step 7: Stop


3. Algorithm to Calculate Area of a Circle Using Math Library

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Import the math library

Step 3: Declare variable r for radius

Step 4: Read the value of r

Step 5: Calculate area using formula

   area = math.pi × r × r
   
Step 6: Display the area of the circle

Step 7: Stop


CONCLUSION:- WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED THE OPERATIONS IN PYTHON AND WE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF PYTHON.
